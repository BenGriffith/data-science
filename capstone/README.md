## Experimental Design: Default of Credit Card Clients
  - Conducted data cleaning and data exploration along with statistical analysis to determine whether women who defaulted on credit cards had higher credit limits on average than males who defaulted on credit cards.
  - In this project, I used Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn and Matplotlib.

## Supervised Learning: Vehicle Price Prediction
  - Performed data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, algorithm selection, parameter tuning and model evaluation in order to predict vehicle prices.
  - In this project, I used Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, WordCloud, Scipy, Supervised Learning and Scikit-Learn.

## Unsupervised Learning: Netflix TV Shows and Movies
  - Performed data cleaning, data exploration, feature engineering, algorithm selection, parameter tuning, model evaluation and dimensionality reduction in order to identify similar Netflix TV Shows and Movies.
  - In this project, I used Python, Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, WordCloud, Scipy, Unsupervised Learning and Scikit-Learn.
